# List of upcoming and past PASA events.
#
# This file will be parsed by `../js/events.js` and displayed on the events page.
#
# An event entry can contain the following parameters:
#   - title: Example Title                    Title of event
#     start: "2022-08-18 17:00:00"            Starting date and time
#     end: 2022-08-18 22:00:00"               Ending date and time
#     allday: true                            If event is all day (ignores times above)
#     venue: ST 140                           Event location
#     website: "https://pasa.website"         Event link
#     summary: Example summary                Summary of event
#
# The parameters above can be in any order and are all optional; however, not including
# things like the title or starting date may lead to crashes.
#
# The order of the events listed here do not necessarily need to be in chronological
# order. Assuming the JS code doesn't break, it should sort by date before displaying.
# Though it's probably useful to keep it somewhat ordered.
