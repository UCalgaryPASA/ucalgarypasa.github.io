                                Depending on executive availability, the club room is often open weekdays between roughly between 8am
                                and 8pm (when people are around). Come find us in ST 058-060!
                                <br><br><b>Mentorship</b><br>
                                We offer a mentorship program for new students where individuals are paired with an experienced
                                member of similar interests for personal and academic assistance. Please visit our Discord server
                                or speak with an executive member for more information and the sign-up sheet.

                                We offer a weekly tutorial night for students to come by and get help with their courses. Hosted by executives
                                E and Abby, this is a great opportunity ask questions about courses, labs, concepts, schedules, and more! It
                                is available on discord and in the PASA club room. More details can be found in the announcements channel on our
